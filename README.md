# tabSidian

tabSidian is a Microsoft Edge browser extension that helps users easily generate an Obsidian-compatible markdown file containing a list of their open tabs. The extension filters out pre-defined restricted URLs, such as settings and pinned tabs, and organizes the remaining tabs with their titles and URLs in a markdown format.

ðŸš€ Latest version: [tabSidian 1.7.1](versions/tabSidian_1.7.1.zip)

## Usage

1. Click on the tabSidian extension icon in the toolbar.
2. The extension will process all open tabs (excluding restricted URLs) and generate a markdown file.
3. A download prompt will appear, allowing you to save the generated markdown file to your local storage.
4. Import the markdown file into Obsidian or any other markdown-compatible application for further use.
5. You may add more restricted URLs by right-clicking the extension icon and opening the Options page.
6. You may customize the markdown surrounding your Title and URL to fit your Obsidian style. Examples are provided in the extension's options page.

## Tips

1. Create a folder in your Obsidian vault to store all the markdown files generated by tabSidian.
2. Pin this folder to Quick Access for easier access when saving the files.
3. Select two or more tabs to save only those tabs.
4. Pinned tabs are ignored by default.
5. Add any url you want ignored to the extension options page.
6. Modify the markdown to fit your Obsidian needs.

## Sample Output

The generated markdown file will have a default format similar to the following:

![](sample-output.png)

> \---
>
> date_created: 2023-04-11
>
> time_created: 16:58:42
>
> \---
>
> ## Tab Title 1
>
> [https://example1.com](https://example1.com)
>
> ## Tab Title 2
>
> [https://example2.com](https://example2.com)

You may replace the default markdown with your own to match your workflow. Use {title} and {url} placeholders to show the tab's Title and URL. You may also use "\n" to create a new line.

## Limitations

1. tabSidian only works on the active window. If you have many browser windows open with many tabs in each one, you will need to process each browser window individually.
2. Due to restrictions on extensions, tabSidian cannot automatically save the file for you (or even open the right folder every time).
